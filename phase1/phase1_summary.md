# Phase 1 Summary — Community College Educators on YouTube Shorts

## 🎯 Segment Focus
**Segment:** Community College Educators  
**Platform:** YouTube Shorts  
**Goal:** Empower community college educators to create engaging microlearning content on Shorts, expanding YouTube’s educational impact and driving new growth in the learning ecosystem.

Community colleges serve millions of students from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, yet their educators remain largely absent from the short-form education space. By understanding the barriers and opportunities for this segment, YouTube can both strengthen its education vertical and align with its mission to make knowledge accessible for everyone.

## 💡 Problem Statement
Despite YouTube’s dominance in educational video, most community college educators have not adopted **Shorts** as a teaching or outreach tool. Many lack awareness of Shorts’ potential, face time constraints, or don’t see clear incentives to produce 60-second content.

> **Key question:** How can YouTube accelerate growth and monetization among community college educators using Shorts — and what would be the strategic impact on engagement, educational outcomes, and platform revenue over the next 3 years?

---

## 🧠 Hypotheses

1. **Adoption Hypothesis**  
   Community college educators are underrepresented on YouTube Shorts due to low awareness of creator tools, difficulty condensing lessons into 60-second formats, and limited institutional support.

2. **Impact Hypothesis**  
   Increasing the number of education-focused Shorts creators by 20% could boost total educational watch time by up to 40% within 18 months.

3. **Business Hypothesis**  
   A dedicated **Education Shorts Accelerator Program** could expand YouTube’s education vertical, attract new advertisers (edtech, colleges, workforce programs), and strengthen brand equity in accessible learning.

## 🔍 Research Questions

1. What is the current presence and growth rate of educational creators using Shorts?  
2. What barriers (technical, motivational, time-based) do community college educators face when creating short-form content?  
3. How do educational creators on YouTube perform compared to similar educators on TikTok or Instagram Reels?  
4. Which strategic levers — training, incentives, interface design, community building — could most effectively increase educator participation?  
5. What is the potential engagement and revenue uplift if YouTube invests in supporting this creator segment?

- Metrics: subscribers, total views, Shorts vs. long-form content ratio, engagement rates.  
- Tools: YouTube Data API, SocialBlade, Google Sheets.

**Qualitative Plan**
- Conduct short interviews or surveys with 3–5 community college instructors who post on YouTube.  
- Supplement with public creator insights (e.g., Reddit, Twitter, YouTube Creator Blog).  
- Focus on perceived value, challenges, and resource needs.
